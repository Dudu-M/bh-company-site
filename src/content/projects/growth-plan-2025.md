## Beyond Extraction: Sustaining the Future of Mining

*"Beyond Extraction: Sustaining the future of mining"*, said President Mnangagwa at Mine Entra 2025. *"As we industrialise and modernise our economy, the integrated role of mining, engineering, and transport remains the bedrock of sustainable economic development. The focus is now on how these sectors innovate and evolve to ensure long-term environmental stewardship, community empowerment, and economic stability."*


## Project Overview

BH's short term roll out plan is to implement the first of seven parts of our economic growth strategy initiative, through sustainable rehabilitation of the mineral resources sector, community development and empowerment by encompassing informal artisanal mining into the formal tax paying sector of industry. 

We have also decided to partner with **'Woman in Mining Africa'** under the SADC community to empower the women in mining in Zimbabwe.


## Short Term Roll Out Plan

At Beth Hakkerem Enterprise, our 2025-2026 short term roll out plan is to implement the first of seven parts of our economic growth strategy initiative, through sustainable rehabilitation of the mineral resources sector, community development and empowerment by encompassing informal artisanal mining into the formal tax paying sector of industry: Building the national **"GOLD RESERVE"**, from the ruins, every gram will count.


### Partnership with Women in Mining Africa

As an organization, apart from our holistic ASM development strategy, we have decided to partner with 'Woman in Mining Africa' under the SADC community, who have extended us as a Metallurgist Chapter of Zimbabwe which is a technocratic platform to empower the women in mining in Zimbabwe as our contribution to the advancement of the action plan to move women from survival mode to significance within the mineral sector value chain, while reinforcing the seven-point program Agenda (7PPA).


## Phase One - Matabeleland Region, 14 Minerals

Our first phase budget outlays and financial models are ready for the provincial outreach which we have decided as a chapter to start implementation within the Matabeleland region. 

BH holds vast mineral portfolio hence our roll out plan will focus on **14 minerals**, we have divided the region into its respective:

- **North** - Critical metals (Copper, Cobalt, Lithium and Rare Earths)
- **South** - Precious metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum Group Metals)

Our investor register is secured within a 'Wealth Strategy Initiative' virtual briefcase.


## Skills Development Initiative Outreach Program

Below is the concise outline of what is included within the skills development initiative outreach program:

### 1.0 Implementation Plan

- **Cost management** - Optimizing operational expenses and resource allocation
- **Equipment selection and sizing** - Appropriate technology for scale and efficiency
- **Safe materials handling** - Ensuring worker safety and material integrity
- **Process dynamics and viable plant designs** - Engineering sustainable operations
- **Process optimization** - Maximizing efficiency and output quality
- **Water management** - Sustainable water use and recycling systems
- **Waste management** - Minimizing environmental impact
- **Power and alternative source management** - Renewable energy integration


## Mercury Abatement Program

We have earmarked this first of seven as the essential building block for **'The Mercury Abatement Program'** that we are part of with our East and West African ASM partners whose mantra goes, *'Nothing about us without us!'* 

This is part of our agenda to ensure that the African gram/ounce/carat/tonne of mineral value gets its LME market share price through automatic entry into the SDG17 accreditation system. This model will be used as a template across Africa.


## Initiative Partners

Our initiative partners include:

- **Agronomists** - Soil rehabilitation and enrichment specialists
- **Economists** - Economic blueprints and financial modeling experts
- **Legal Titans** - Regulatory compliance and rights protection
- **Mining Technocrats** - Technical innovation and process optimization

These partners individually hold patented products, economic blueprints, new process innovations and latest technologies specialized for:

- Soil rehabilitation and enrichment post-mining
- Water management systems
- Optimized mineral processing technologies
- Innovative EV metal process technologies
- Sustainable mine waste management

Our mandate is a **green space environment** where we hold the miners' hand from exploration to rehabilitation after market.


## Expected Impact

This comprehensive initiative will deliver:

- **Economic Empowerment** - Formalizing artisanal mining into the tax-paying sector
- **Community Development** - Skills training and capacity building for local communities
- **Environmental Stewardship** - Sustainable rehabilitation of mining areas
- **Gender Equality** - Empowering women in the mining sector through partnership with Women in Mining Africa
- **National Growth** - Contributing to Zimbabwe's gold reserve and economic development
- **Regional Model** - Creating a replicable framework for sustainable mining across Africa


## Closing Remarks

As Beth Hakkerem embarks on the implementation of the economic emancipation strategy blueprint for the South, we are keen to partner and support initiatives that align with our vision and to teach through our own practice that mineral resource custodianship requires a high level of stewardship and selflessness in order to achieve the enrichment of a nation.

**We do not believe that mineral resource custodians should seek government monetary assistance** as we have been mandated to be the lenders of last resort. Instead we stand to educate the custodians that the resource speaks for itself when presented as the "Value" - we bring in the Dole.
