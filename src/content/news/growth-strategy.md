### Overview

BH's short term roll out plan is to implement the first of seven parts of our economic growth strategy initiative, through sustainable rehabilitation of the mineral resources sector, community development and empowerment by encompassing informal artisanal mining into the formal tax paying sector of industry. We have also decided to partner with 'Woman in mining Africa ' under the SADC community to empower the women in mining in Zimbabwe.

*“Beyond Extraction: Sustaining the future of mining,”* said President Mnangagwa at Mine Entra 2025.  *“As we industrialise and modernise our economy, the integrated role of mining, engineering, and transport remains the bedrock of sustainable economic development. The focus is now on how these sectors innovate and evolve to ensure long-term environmental stewardship, community empowerment, and economic stability.”*

### Short-Term Rollout Plan

At Beth Hakkerem Enterprise our 2025-2026 short term roll out plan is to implement the first of seven parts of our economic growth strategy initiative, through sustainable rehabilitation of the mineral resources sector, community development and empowerment by encompassing informal artisanal mining into the formal tax paying sector of industry: Building the national, "GOLD RESERVE", from the ruins, every gram will count.

<br>
  
As an organization, apart from our holistic ASM development strategy, we have decided to partner with 'Woman in mining Africa ' under the SADC community, who have extended us as a Metallurgist Chapter of Zimbabwe which is a technocratic platform to empower the women in mining in Zimbabwe as our contribution to the advancement of the action plan to move women from survival mode to significance within the mineral sector value chain, while reinforcing the seven-point program Agenda (7PPA).

### Phase One - Matabeleland Region, 14 Minerals

Our first phase budget outlays and financial models are ready for the provincial outreach which we have decided as a chapter to start implementation within the Matabeleland region. BH holds vast mineral portfolio hence our roll out plan will focus on 14 minerals. We have divided the region into its respective north for critical metals (and the south for precious metals.

<br>

**Northern Matabeleland – Critical Metals**

• Copper  
• Cobalt  
• Lithium  
• Rare Earth Elements  

<br>

**Southern Matabeleland – Precious Metals**

• Gold  
• Silver  
• Platinum Group Metals (PGMs)

<br>

Our investor register is secured within a 'Wealth Strategy initiative' virtual briefcase.

    <ul>
        <li>1. Cost management </li>
        <li>2. Equipment selection and sizing  </li>
        <li>3. Safe materials handling </li>
        <li>4. Process dynamics and viable plant design</li>
        <li>5. Process optimisation </li>
        <li>6. Water management </li>
        <li>7. Waste management </li>
        <li>8. Power and alternative energy source management  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<br>
  
We have earmarked this first of seven as the essential building block for, 'The mercury abatement program' that we are part of with our East and West African ASM partners whose mantra goes, 'Nothing about us without us!' This is part of our agenda to ensure that the African gram/ounce/carat/tonne of mineral value gets it's LME market share price through automatic entry into the SDG17 accreditation system. This model will be used as a model across Africa..

<br>

### Initiative Partners

Our initiative partners include, Agronomists, economists, legal titans and mining technocrats who individually hold, patented products, economic blueprints, new process innovations and latest technologies specialized for the soil rehabilitation, enrichment, water management post mining, optimized mineral processing technologies, innovative EV metal process technologies and sustainable mine waste management. Our mandate is a green space environment where we hold the miners hand from exploration to rehabilitation after market.

### Closing Remarks

As Beth Hakkerem advances the implementation of its economic emancipation strategy blueprint for the South, we remain committed to partnerships that align with our long-term vision. We believe mineral resource custodianship requires stewardship, selflessness, and long-term environmental responsibility to achieve true national enrichment.  

BH does not advocate for government monetary assistance. Instead, we position ourselves as lenders of last resort, educating custodians that when mineral resources are presented as true value, capital follows.
